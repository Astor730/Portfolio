   				<p class="lead">I recently graduated from Northeastern, completing my BS in computer science and game development. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about games and their design. In my time at Northeastern 
					I developed a deeper appreciation for  the medium and the work that it takes to make a great game. The process of making games is incredibly fulfilling. I love the energy of collaboration, and how 
					the interplay of ideas and feedback between my teammates and I results in unexpected creative solutions, unique experiences, and often, a beautiful end result.</p>

						  <p>Team Size: 19</p>
						  <p>Project timeline: 4 Months</p>
						  <p>My role: Gameplay Programmer</p>
						  <p>My Work:
							<p>-Implemented collision physics for the player's grappling hook. This included added a collider to the hook so it would bounce off of walls and ceilings as well as check the wire for collisions so it wouldn't go through walls and platforms.</p>
							<p>-Scripted a new battery that could gain or lose energy without the input of the player. I also coded an effects script that would display a custom effect based on whether the battery was gaining or losing energy.</p>
							<p>-Coupled a particle system with the player's drain and charge ability to play a particle effect when the player is using their ability.</p>
							<p>-Fixed a number of outstanding bugs including fixing the battery display to and stopping the player's velocity on death to fix uninteded checkpoint jumps.</p>
							<p>-Utilized Jira to create and keep track of tasks with my team memebers.</p>

					   <h3>Bachelor Degree</h3>
					   <p>September 2019 - May 2024</p>
				   </div>

				   <div class="timeline-content">
					   <h4>Northeastern University</h4>
					   <p>I chose to go to Northeastern University because I wanted to have a strong foundation in both computer science and game development. 
						During my time at Northeastern I was definitely able to achieve that goal, as the courses offered for both elements of my degree were 
						challenging and instructive.</p>
				   </div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
					<p>Classes: Computer systems, Foundations of C++, Fundamentals of software engineering, Object Oriented Design.</p>
					<p>Foundations of Software Engineering(Highlight): One of the hardest things of software engineering is understanding and then working in an
					already existing code base. That's what I was able to really improve in this class. All of the projects I had to work on were in 
					covey.town. A virtual meeting space where users could interact over the web. The final project was to implement a new feature in this
					code base. My team made a mock stock market exchange game for the users of covey.town. I worked on the design and implementation of 
					the communication between the database and the runtime environment. I had to decide what data should be pulled from the database that 
					the user might want as well as implementing those data pulls. All of our code had to be unit tested so all of the features had to be 
					visible to a testing suite.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Game Development</h4>
					<p>Classes: Game Programming, Game studio, Game interface design, Building Game Engines and Level Design.</p>
					<p>Game Interface Design(Highlight): I want to highlight Game interface Design here because I really got to express my creativity in the 
					final project for this class. Our final project had to implement a unique interface. The team I worked on developed a co-op maze game, 
					where one player can only see the maze and one player can only hear elements of the maze. Players had to work together to avoid the 
					monsters in the maze and find the exit. I mostly worked on design decisions and play testing. Because of the co-op nature of the game 
					both players need to have important roles to reach the goal, for our game this meant making the hearing player more important by giving 
					them information on the exit and making the monsters more dangerous so the seeing player had to rely on the hearing player to not get 
					caught by the monsters in the maze.</p>
