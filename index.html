   				<p class="lead">I’m a fifth year Northeastern student, completing my BS in computer science and game development. I’ve always been
					passionate about games and their design. In my time at Northeastern I’ve grown a new found appreciation and enjoyment of the 
					medium and the work that it takes to make a great game. The process of making games is incredibly fulfilling. The collabrative process of 
					bouncing ideas off of teammates to iron out what needs to be implemented and how. Then taking those ideas, implementing them and coming back
					for feedback is very rewarding. It's really amazing to watch your ideas and work blend together to make that unique experience is truly 
					amazing.</p>

					      <h4>Sight and Noise</h4>		      
					      <p>Description: This is what the hearing player's ui looked like. It is an aduio visual interface along with a key for clarity. Along with the 
							interface there is spacial audio as well. 
							What I did: I mostly worked on balancing between the hearing player and the seeing player. This included making the hearing player more 
							self sufficient by giving them an audio que when they are hitting a wall. I also conceptualized and implemented the hearing player
							having the ability to hear the exit. This made the seeing player more reliant on the hearing player to find the exit. I also made
							the monsters in the maze more dangerous so that the hearing player was neccessary to avoid the monsters. A lot of the changes
							happened after running playtests which I also helped faciliate and organize the feedback for.

					      <h4>Escape Veloctiy</h4>		      
					      <p>The main mechanic is the player's ability to switch gravity. The game area is a space ship so there are many tight corridors and 
							small spaces. In this space there are enemies that need to be defeated and puzzles to solve.
							I worked in a lot of different areas for this project. I did most of the model importing, animation and particle effects and physics. 
							Along with this was working on the physics for all these objects and the player. It was a bit challenging because of the gravity 
							switching mechanic, the player controller had to work under two different modes of gravity. There were special interactions
							on the ship such as buttons and trapped that I implemented.

					      <h4>Underworld's Pursuit</h4>		      
					      <p>This is a 2D action platformer boss rush. The player uses their gun and other abilities to defeat each boss and move on.
							New abilities are aquired after every boss is defeated. 
							I worked on the implementation of the player abilities, the menus and running playtests. The player abilities are very physics
							heavy because we wanted the game to be very technical and precise. This means I didn't use the built in unity physics to implement
							these. These abilities included a dash and a reflect. There were also a lot of design decisions that had to be made around the
							reflect and other challenges that arised from how our projectiles were coded. The menus required a game manager as well to handle
							linking the scene transistions and the levels.

					      <p>This is a pokemon rougelike. The player enters a dream world every night where they can battle and capture dreambeasts.
							The dream beasts are corrupted animals that have taken obscure forms.
							I worked on concepting dream beasts and skills as well as implementing the skill animations. We had different classes of Dream 
							Beasts, so I had to concept different types of beasts for each class. Each of them had to have a distinct identity and understandable
							concept for our artist to actually draw. They also had to have a set of base stats that fit along thier own theme as well as their class.
							I wasn't making the animations from scratch. I was taking pre made particle systems or sprite animations and chaning them to fit specific
							skills. I also had to make the animations and particle systems work with the battle system. This required a lot of research into the Unity
							animation system, animation clips, animation events and functions for instantiating those events.

					   <h3>Bachelor Degree</h3>
					   <p>September 2019 - Present</p>
				   </div>

				   <div class="timeline-content">
					   <h4>Northeastern University</h4>
					   <p>I choose to go to Northeastern University because I wanted to have a strong foundation in both computer science and game development.
						During my time at northeastern I was definitely able to achieve that goal as the courses offered for both elements of my degree were 
						challenging and instructive.</p>
				   </div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
					<p>Classes: Computer systems, Foundations of C++, Fundamentals of software engineering, Object Oriented Design. 
						Foundations of Software Enginnering(Highlight): One of the hardest things of software engineering is understanding and then working in 
						an already existing code base. That's what I was able to really imporve in this class. All of the projects I had to work on were in 
						covey.town. A virtual meeting space where users could interact over the web. The final project was to implement a new feature in this 
						code base. My team made a mock stock market exchange game for the users of covey.town. I worked on the design and implementation of the 
						communication between the data base and the run time enviornment. I had to decide what data should be pulled from the data base that the
						user might want as well as implementing those data pulls. All of our code had to be unit tested so all of the features had to be
						visible to a testing suite. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Game Development</h4>
					<p>Classes: Game Programming, Game studio, Game interface design, Building Game Engines and Level Design. 
						Game Interface Design(Highlight): I want to highlight Game interface Design here because I really got to express my creativity in the 
						final project for this class. Our final project had to implement a unique interface. The team I worked on developed a co-op maze game, 
						where one player can only see the maze and one player can only hear elements of the maze. Players had to work together to avoid the 
						monsters in the maze and find the exit. I mostly worked on design decisions and play testing. Because of the co-op nature of the game 
						both players need to have important roles to reach the goal, for our game this meant making the hearing player more important by giving 
						them information on the exit and making the monsters more dangerous so the seeing player had to rely on the hearing player to not get 
						caught by the monsters in the maze.</p>
