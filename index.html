   				<p class="lead">I recently graduated from Northeastern, completing my BS in computer science and game development. I’ve always been passionate about games and their design. In my time at Northeastern 
					I developed a deeper appreciation for  the medium and the work that it takes to make a great game. The process of making games is incredibly fulfilling. I love the energy of collaboration, and how 
					the interplay of ideas and feedback between my teammates and I results in unexpected creative solutions, unique experiences, and often, a beautiful end result.</p>

					      <h4>Sight and Noise</h4>		      
					      <p>Description: This is a co-op game where players try to escape a monster infested maze. 
							One player can only see the game world and the other player can only hear elements of the game.</p>
						 <p>My deisgn challenge: I was tasked with balancing player satisfaction between the hearing and seeing player. mostly worked on balancing between the hearing player and the 
							seeing player. Early on in the game’s development the seeing player was a lot more fun to play than the hearing player because audio wasn’t integral to complete the maze. 
							This led to the seeing player often abandoning the hearing player and the hearing player feeling useless. One change I designed and coded was giving the hearing player an 
							audio cue when they hit a wall thus making it easier to navigate on their own. Another change I designed and coded was giving the hearing player the ability to hear the exit 
							to make the seeing player more reliant on the hearing player. My final change was to increase the threat of the monsters by making them too fast to run from. Early on the seeing
							player could just see where the monster was and easily avoid them even though that was supposed to be the hearing player’s job. By making the monster faster, players would 
							have to avoid where the monsters were instead of running away from them, meaning the hearing player’s ability to hear the direction of the monsters was more valuable. 
							The seeing player couldn’t navigate the maze on their own without having a high risk of being caught.

					      <h4>Escape Veloctiy</h4>
						  <p>Description: This is a 3d puzzle game where the player has to navigate through a spaceship. The puzzles are built around the player’s ability to switch gravity. 
							They use this ability to find new paths and buttons or get around obstacles. </p>		      
					      <p>My design and coding challenges: The gravity switching ability was not an easy ability to code. To make sure that the player controls upside down and right side
							up I had to track the gravity state of the character and inverse the vector modification based on that state. The game objects also had to have independent physics 
							so that the gravity switching didn’t apply to them, which meant I couldn’t use the default collisions in Unity. I had to code all the collision states and interactions.
							My other challenge was adding some level of polish to the game. So I added some particle effects to the drone explosions, to the player’s gun and button presses. 
							I found some free models I could use for the boss and the drones. There were some animations that came with the boss model so I rigged those animations as well to
							make the boss fight feel more immersive. I added some spaceship textures to the walls to give the puzzles more life.

						  <p>Description:  Underworld’s Pursuit is a 2D action platformer boss rush. The player uses their gun and other abilities to defeat the boss.</p>     
					      <p>My coding challenge: I was in charge of coding the player physics. The main challenge here was making the dash work how we wanted. Temporarily 
							turning off the player’s gravity and applying an impulse to the player didn’t work, so I decided not to use Unity’s built in physics to allow for more
							control. What I ended up doing was having the player move along a straight vector in the direction of their last input and no other movement functions would 
							run during this time to prevent the player from falling. While the player wasn’t dashing I could check for jumps or double jumps and apply gravity forces. 
							Applying an impulse to the player worked for the jump because it allowed gravity to be applied after and created an expected jump behavior.

							The dream beasts are corrupted animals that have taken obscure forms.
						  </p>	      
					      <p>My coding challenge: I worked on data persistence throughout the dreamworld. Because we wanted a dungeon type of gameplay loop all of the player’s and dream beast 
							data had to persist between the map and each battle. So I created a container class for the player data instead of a static class so that data could be stored in
							more than methods. This class had a special method so it wouldn’t be destroyed when a new scene loaded and had a list of the player’s dream beasts that they chose 
							in the starting area as well as their position on the map. I also was tasked with adding battle animations. I found some particle animations and imported them 
							our project. Then added them into the battle system by instantiating the particle system as a game object when the move was triggered in the battle system.

					   <h3>Bachelor Degree</h3>
					   <p>September 2019 - May 2024</p>
				   </div>

				   <div class="timeline-content">
					   <h4>Northeastern University</h4>
					   <p>I chose to go to Northeastern University because I wanted to have a strong foundation in both computer science and game development. 
						During my time at Northeastern I was definitely able to achieve that goal, as the courses offered for both elements of my degree were 
						challenging and instructive.</p>
				   </div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
					<p>Classes: Computer systems, Foundations of C++, Fundamentals of software engineering, Object Oriented Design.</p>
					<p>Foundations of Software Engineering(Highlight): One of the hardest things of software engineering is understanding and then working in an
					already existing code base. That's what I was able to really improve in this class. All of the projects I had to work on were in 
					covey.town. A virtual meeting space where users could interact over the web. The final project was to implement a new feature in this
					code base. My team made a mock stock market exchange game for the users of covey.town. I worked on the design and implementation of 
					the communication between the database and the runtime environment. I had to decide what data should be pulled from the database that 
					the user might want as well as implementing those data pulls. All of our code had to be unit tested so all of the features had to be 
					visible to a testing suite.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Game Development</h4>
					<p>Classes: Game Programming, Game studio, Game interface design, Building Game Engines and Level Design.</p>
					<p>Game Interface Design(Highlight): I want to highlight Game interface Design here because I really got to express my creativity in the 
					final project for this class. Our final project had to implement a unique interface. The team I worked on developed a co-op maze game, 
					where one player can only see the maze and one player can only hear elements of the maze. Players had to work together to avoid the 
					monsters in the maze and find the exit. I mostly worked on design decisions and play testing. Because of the co-op nature of the game 
					both players need to have important roles to reach the goal, for our game this meant making the hearing player more important by giving 
					them information on the exit and making the monsters more dangerous so the seeing player had to rely on the hearing player to not get 
					caught by the monsters in the maze.</p>
