   				<p class="lead">I’m a fifth year Northeastern student, completing my BS in computer science and game development. I’ve always been passionate 
					about games and their design. In my time at Northeastern I have developed a deeper appreciation for  the medium and the work that it takes
					to make a great game. The process of making games is incredibly fulfilling. I love the energy of collaboration, and how the interplay of 
					ideas and feedback between my teammates and I results in unexpected creative solutions, unique experiences, and often, a beautiful end 
					result. </p>

							happening in the maze, while the other player can only hear different aspects of the environment.</p>
						 <p>What I did: I mostly worked on balancing between the hearing player and the seeing player. This included making the hearing player more 
							self sufficient by giving them an audio que when they are hitting a wall. I also conceptualized and implemented the hearing player
							having the ability to hear the exit. This made the seeing player more reliant on the hearing player to find the exit. I also made
							the monsters in the maze more dangerous so that the hearing player was neccessary to avoid the monsters. A lot of the changes
							happened after running playtests which I also helped faciliate and organize the feedback for.

					      <h4>Escape Veloctiy</h4>
						  <p>Description: This is a 3d puzzle game where the player has to navigate through a spaceship solving puzzles and defeating enemies. 
							 The main tool the player has to solve these puzzles is their ability to switch gravity. They can use this ability to dodge 
							 obstacles, access buttons and find new paths.</p>		      
					      <p>The main mechanic is the player's ability to switch gravity. The game area is a space ship so there are many tight corridors and 
							small spaces. In this space there are enemies that need to be defeated and puzzles to solve.
							I worked in a lot of different areas for this project. I did most of the model importing, animation and particle effects and physics. 
							Along with this was working on the physics for all these objects and the player. It was a bit challenging because of the gravity 
							switching mechanic, the player controller had to work under two different modes of gravity. There were special interactions
							on the ship such as buttons and trapped that I implemented.

							New abilities are required after every boss is defeated.</p>     
					      <p>What I did: I worked on the implementation of the player abilities, the menus and running playtests. The player abilities, which
							included a dash and a reflect, were  very physics heavy because we wanted the game to be very technical and precise, therefore I 
							didn't use the built in unity physics to implement them. There were also a lot of design decisions that had to be made around the
							reflect and other challenges that arose from how our projectiles were coded. The menus required a game manager as well to handle 
							linking the scene transitions and the levels.

						  </p>	      
					      <p>What I did: I worked on concepting dream beasts and skills as well as implementing the skill animations. We had different classes 
							of DreamBeasts, so I had to conceive different types of beasts for each class. Each of them had to have a distinct identity and 
							understandable concept for our artist to actually draw. They also had to have a set of base stats that fit along their own theme as
							well as their class. While I didn’t create  the animations from scratch, I did alter  pre-made particle systems or sprite 
							animations and changed  them to fit specific skills. I also had to make the animations and particle systems work with the battle
							system. This required a lot of research into the Unity animation system, animation clips, animation events and functions for 
							initiating  those events.

					   <h3>Bachelor Degree</h3>
					   <p>September 2019 - Present</p>
				   </div>

				   <div class="timeline-content">
					   <h4>Northeastern University</h4>
					   <p>I chose to go to Northeastern University because I wanted to have a strong foundation in both computer science and game development. 
						During my time at Northeastern I was definitely able to achieve that goal, as the courses offered for both elements of my degree were 
						challenging and instructive.</p>
				   </div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
					<p>Classes: Computer systems, Foundations of C++, Fundamentals of software engineering, Object Oriented Design.</p>
					<p>Foundations of Software Engineering(Highlight): One of the hardest things of software engineering is understanding and then working in an
					already existing code base. That's what I was able to really improve in this class. All of the projects I had to work on were in 
					covey.town. A virtual meeting space where users could interact over the web. The final project was to implement a new feature in this
					code base. My team made a mock stock market exchange game for the users of covey.town. I worked on the design and implementation of 
					the communication between the database and the runtime environment. I had to decide what data should be pulled from the database that 
					the user might want as well as implementing those data pulls. All of our code had to be unit tested so all of the features had to be 
					visible to a testing suite.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="timeline-content">
					<h4>Game Development</h4>
					<p>Classes: Game Programming, Game studio, Game interface design, Building Game Engines and Level Design.</p>
					<p>Game Interface Design(Highlight): I want to highlight Game interface Design here because I really got to express my creativity in the 
					final project for this class. Our final project had to implement a unique interface. The team I worked on developed a co-op maze game, 
					where one player can only see the maze and one player can only hear elements of the maze. Players had to work together to avoid the 
					monsters in the maze and find the exit. I mostly worked on design decisions and play testing. Because of the co-op nature of the game 
					both players need to have important roles to reach the goal, for our game this meant making the hearing player more important by giving 
					them information on the exit and making the monsters more dangerous so the seeing player had to rely on the hearing player to not get 
					caught by the monsters in the maze.</p>
